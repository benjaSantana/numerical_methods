# Numerical Methods 

A repository with numerical methods algorithms implemented in C and python. The algorithms are based in a class I'm taking.
The algorithms may need some work, so feel free to upgrade them :)

## Installation

They are a bunch of C files, so just download the one you want, and use your favorite compiler.

```bash
$ gcc newton_rasp.c -o newton.o -lm
```
**Note:** you may need to use -lm to include the <math.h> header file.

In the case of python just, 

```bash
$ python3 <algorithm>.py
```

## Usage

In most of the algorithms you need to input the function f(x), or the equation system directly into the file.
